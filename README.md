# Yiimp for Ubuntu 22.04, PHP 8.2 & Yii Framework 1.1.29!
## What's known to be broken
- ...

## To install this Yiimp fork use our Yiimp install script.
```
https://github.com/saltpool/yiimp_install_script, pulling the yiimp_install_script-8.2 branch.
```
-  From there follow the instructions and then Yiimp will be installed.

## This is still a work-in-progress. Do not use on your production server yet!
