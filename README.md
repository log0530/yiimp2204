# Yiimp for Ubuntu 22.04, PHP 8.2 & Yii Framework 1.1.29!

## Note: You will most likely want to use an installer script to use this repo.
You can struggle through it yourself it you want, but this Yiimp repo is designed to be used with https://github.com/saltpool/yiimp_install_script

## What's new?
- 24 colour "themes" added

## What's known to be broken
- Themes are in beta so there are bound to be things that break.

## To install this Yiimp fork use our Yiimp install script.
```
https://github.com/saltpool/yiimp_install_script, pulling the yiimp_install_script-8.2 branch.
```
-  From there follow the instructions and then Yiimp will be installed.

## This is still a work-in-progress. Do not use on your production server yet!
